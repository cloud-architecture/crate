Unreleased Changes
==================

This file collects *unreleased* changes only.

For release notes, see:

  https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/release_notes/index.html

For developers: changes should be recorded here (using RST syntax) as you are
developing CrateDB. When a new release is being cut, changes will be moved to
the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

 - Columns aren't implicitly casted to a type anymore. Whenever columns are
   compared to Literals (e.g. 'string' or a number), these literals will be
   converted to the column type but not vice-versa. The column can still be
   manually casted to a type by using a cast function.
